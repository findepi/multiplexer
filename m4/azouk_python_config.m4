# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AZOUK_PYTHON_CONFIG
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   Try to find python-config based on $PYTHON set by $AM_PATH_PYTHON
#
#   It set PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR to the directory holding the header files, and
#   PYTHON_LIB to the name of the Python library, based on a call to
#   python-config.
#
#   This macro calls AC_SUBST on PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR and PYTHON_LIB.
